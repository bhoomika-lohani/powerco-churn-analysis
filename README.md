# PowerCo – Customer Churn Prediction (SME Segment)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for PowerCo’s SME customers and builds a machine learning model to identify high-risk customers in advance.

## Project Structure
- **powerco-churn-eda.ipynb** – Exploratory data analysis and key churn insights  
- **powerco-feature-engineering.ipynb** – Creation of pricing, consumption, and tenure-based features  
- **PowerCo_Churn_Modeling.ipynb** – Random Forest model training, evaluation, and interpretation  
- **Executive_Summary.pdf** – Business-facing summary with recommendations

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Key Outcome
The model identifies price-sensitive SME customers at high risk of churn, enabling targeted retention strategies and proactive intervention.
